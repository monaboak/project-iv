    <p>The first ever iPhone was introduced to the world on January 9th, 2007 in San Francisco, California. It was marketed as being a “revolutionary new mobile phone” due to its many features -touch controls, web browsing, maps etc.- all on a small and lightweight device 
        </p>
    <h2 style="font-style:italic;">“iPhone is a revolutionary and magical product that is literally five years ahead of any other mobile phone,” said Steve Jobs, Apple’s CEO. “We are all born with the ultimate pointing device—our fingers—and iPhone uses them to create the most revolutionary user interface since the mouse.”</h2>
    <p>
        As a company, Apple -which was founded in April of 1976- was already successful, having seen commercial success with their desktop, “macbook” laptops, and iPods. This success continued with the release of first iPhone. After its official release in September of 2007, Apple sold 1.39 million iPhones in six different countries.
