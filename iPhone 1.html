      The first ever iPhone was introduced to the world on January 9th, 2007 in
      San Francisco, California. It was marketed as being a “revolutionary new
      mobile phone” due to its many features -touch controls, web browsing, maps
      etc.- all on a small and lightweight device “iPhone is a revolutionary and
      magical product that is literally five years ahead of any other mobile
      phone,” said Steve Jobs, Apple’s CEO. “We are all born with the ultimate
      pointing device—our fingers—and iPhone uses them to create the most
      revolutionary user interface since the mouse.” As a company, Apple -which
      was founded in April of 1976- was already successful, having seen
      commercial success with their desktop, “macbook” laptops, and iPods. This
      success continued with the release of first iPhone. After its official
      release in September of 2007, Apple sold 1.39 million iPhone’s In the six
      countries that it was released in.
