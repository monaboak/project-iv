      After seeing the success of the first iPhone, Apple released the second
      generation- ‘iPhone 3G’ a year later in 2008. This time around, Apple
      released the iPhone in twenty-two different countries (including the
      original six). The new model included several new tweaks. Two versions of
      the 3G were being offered- the 8GB model and the 16GB model. A big
      bragging card for Apple was the new speed and reduced cost of the 3G
      model. “Just one year after launching the iPhone, we’re launching the new
      iPhone 3G that is twice as fast at half the price,” said Steve Jobs,
      Apple’s CEO. “ The now famous ‘App Store’ was included with the release of
      this iPhone model. Allowing users to purchase and download apps
      wirelessly. The internet service “MobileMe” was also introduced- which was
      essentially an early version of iCloud. A few months after it’s initial
      release date, Apple made the phone available in seventy countries. The
      release of the 3G caused chaos among the market. People were camping out
      for days outside of Apple Stores in order to get their hands on the phone.
      The jump in unit sales from the original iPhone model to the 3G proved to
      be quite impressive- in 2008 Apple sold 11.63 million units worldwide.
