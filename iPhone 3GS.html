      The iPhone 3GS was released on June 19th, 2009. During the press release
      in San Francisco on June 8th, 2009, Apple assured the public that this
      iPhone would prove to be the best model yet. The 3GS model was described
      as the “fastest, most powerful iPhone yet, packed with incredible new
      features including improved speed and performance—up to twice as fast as
      iPhone 3G—with longer battery life, a high-quality 3 megapixel autofocus
      camera, easy to use video recording and hands free voice control.” The new
      operating system introduced with the 3GS was the iPhone OS 3.0. This
      system proved to further advance the phone by providing over one hundred
      new usage features (spotlight search, landscape key board, etc.). The 3GS
      release was prior to the birth of ‘Siri’, but it still managed to
      introduce a voice control feature. Voice control offered users hands free
      operation of their iPhone. Apple saw crushing sales, beating their
      previous records by selling 20.73 million units worldwide.
