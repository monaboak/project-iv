      Apple released its next iPhone just over a year later. The iPhone 4 model
      was introduced on June 7th, 2010 and hit the stores a few weeks later on
      June 24th. Apple took this release as an opportunity to remodel the
      physical structure of the iPhone. They marketed it as the “Thinnest
      Smartphone Ever”. It was during this era that the FaceTime feature was
      introduced. Apple accomplished a great deal with this release- greatly
      elevating the iPhone brand. Retina display, 5 megapixel camera and HD
      video recording gave way for the infamous wave of iPhone photography that
      started after the iPhone 4’s release. This release included three storage
      options 8GB, 16GB and 32GB. This iPhone came with Apple’s latest operating
      system IOS4. IOS4 included 100 new features and 1500 new APIs for
      developers. The jump from the 3GS to the 4 was Apple’s biggest to date.
      “iPhone 4 is the biggest leap since the original iPhone,” said Steve Jobs,
      Apple’s CEO. “FaceTime video calling sets a new standard for mobile
      communication, and our new Retina display is the highest resolution
      display ever in a phone, with text looking like it does on a fine printed
      page. We have been dreaming about both of these breakthroughs for
      decades.” The iPhone 4 sold nearly 40 million units worldwide.
