    <h1>2011</h1>
    <p>
      2011 was a major year for Apple and the iPhone. The company launched not
      only a new iPhone model -the 4S- but also released IOS5, iCloud, and the
      wildly popular Siri. the iPhone 4S also included a dual-core A5 chip that
      provided high quality graphics and fast performance. The 2011 iPhone press
      release was held in Cupertino, California on October 4th. Apple had faced
      threats from competitors attempting to mimic iPhone qualities. Due to
      this, they stepped up their game with the 2011 release. iCloud proved to
      be a game changer, because it allowed users to wirelessly store content on
      all their Apple products. This also proved to be a marketing tactic- it
      made more sense for users to not only own an Apple iPhone, but an iPad,
      Mac, and MacBook as well. “iPhone 4S plus iOS 5 plus iCloud is a
      breakthrough combination that makes the iPhone 4S the best iPhone ever,”
      said Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Product
      Marketing. “While our competitors try to imitate iPhone with a checklist
      of features, only iPhone can deliver these breakthrough innovations that
      work seamlessly together.” The iPhone 4S hit the market on October 14th,
      2011, selling 72.3 million units worldwide.
