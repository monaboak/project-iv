      The iPhone 5 was release on September 21st, 2012. Apple took this era to
      remodel the iPhone, with a thinner and longer physical look. They marketed
      the iPhone 5 as the “Thinnest, Lightest iPhone Ever Features All-New
      Aluminum Design, Stunning 4-Inch Retina Display, A6 Chip & Ultrafast
      Wireless”. This release came with iOS 6. This mobile operating system had
      over 200 new features which included the Maps app, Facebook integration,
      and more Siri features and languages. That year, the iPhone 5 was the
      thinnest smart phone in the world. The aluminum body was twenty percent
      thinner than the previous iPhone 4S mode. While the new design did spark
      mixed reviews from consumers, it didn’t slow down the success of the
      iPhone. That year, Apple sold a little over 125 million units worldwide.
      This also marked the start of Apple’s tactic with releasing three new
      iPhone generations under the same number. After the release of the iPhone
      5 came the iPhone 5C and iPhone 5s.

        The iPhone 5c and 5S were released simultaneously, under a year of their
        predecessor, on September 20th 2013. Apple made history, as they
        released two new phones at the same time. This was a major launch for
        Apple. They released two vastly different iPhone models. The iPhone 5S
        followed the sleek and modern appearance of the iPhone 5, while the 5c
        model was more colorful and somewhat youthful. Apple scaled back on the
        distribution of this launch. As the new phones were only available in
        the US, Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan,
        Puerto Rico, Singapore and the UK. The iPhone 5s introduced the Touch
        ID™ feature, which allowed iPhone users to unlock their phone with a
        touch of the finger. “iPhone 5s redefines the best smartphone experience
        in the world with amazing new features all packed into a remarkable thin
        and light design, including the Apple-designed A7 64-bit chip, all-new 8
        megapixel iSight® camera with True Tone flash” The iPhone 5c had an
        unconventional design. The phone came in blue, green. Pink, yellow, and
        white. “iPhone 5c features an all-new design, packed with features
        people know and love like the beautiful 4-inch Retina® display, blazing
        fast performance of the A6 chip, and the 8 megapixel iSight camera—all
        while delivering great battery life.” Both models featured the most
        significant iOS update since the first iPhone- iOS7. The features in
        this operating system update included the Control Center, Notification
        Center, improved Multitasking, AirDrop®, enhanced Photos, Safari®, Siri®
        and introduces iTunes Radio℠, a free Internet radio service based on the
        music you listen to on iTunes®. In 2013, 150.3 million units were sold
        worldwide.
