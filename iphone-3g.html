    <p>After seeing the success of the first iPhone, Apple released the second generation- ‘iPhone 3G’ a year later in 2008. This time around, Apple released the iPhone in twenty-two different countries (including the original six). The new model included several new tweaks. Two versions of the 3G were being offered- the 8GB model and the 16GB model. 

      A big bragging card for Apple was the new speed and reduced cost of the 3G model.
      </p>
    <h2 style="font-style:italic;"> “Just one year after launching the iPhone, we’re launching the new iPhone 3G that is twice as fast at half the price,” said Steve Jobs, Apple’s CEO.</h2>
    <p>The now famous ‘App Store’ was included with the release of this iPhone model. Allowing users to purchase and download apps wirelessly. The internet service “MobileMe” was also introduced- which was essentially an early version of iCloud.   

      A few months after it’s initial release date, Apple made the phone available in seventy countries. The release of the 3G caused chaos among the market. People were camping out for days outside of Apple Stores in order to get their hands on the phone. The jump in unit sales from the original iPhone model to the 3G proved to be quite impressive- in 2008 Apple sold 11.63 million units worldwide.
